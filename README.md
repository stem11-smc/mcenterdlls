ATTENTION!

I will not continue supporting StorePatch method and patching other dlls, and I will ignore issues with requesting patch some dll.

Now there is more good method - PreCracked. And you can download patched MCBE versions here: https://t.me/MPC_MCBE_UWP
If you don't want to, then use M Centers v8 https://mcenters.net/
Because v8 has build-in mechanism to patch DLLs automatically.
